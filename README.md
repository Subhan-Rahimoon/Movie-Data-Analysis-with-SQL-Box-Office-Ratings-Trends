SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS movie_count FROM movies GROUP BY year;
```

SELECT title, boxoffice_usd FROM movies ORDER BY boxoffice_usd DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT title, boxoffice_usd - budget_usd AS profit FROM movies ORDER BY profit DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT genre, ROUND(AVG(budget_usd), 2) AS avg_budget, ROUND(AVG(boxoffice_usd), 2) AS boxoffice FROM movies GROUP BY genre;
SELECT production_company, SUM(boxoffice_usd) AS grossing FROM movies GROUP BY production_company ORDER BY grossing DESC;
```

## üåü 3. Ratings & Popularity

SELECT genre, ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating FROM movies GROUP BY genre ORDER BY avg_rating;
SELECT lead_actor, rating FROM movies GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

## üèÜ 4. Awards & Recognition

UNION ALL
SELECT 'production_company', production_company, ROUND(AVG(num_awards), 2) FROM movies GROUP BY production_company ORDER BY avg_awards DESC;
SELECT genre, SUM(num_awards) AS awards_sum FROM movies GROUP BY genre ORDER BY awards_sum DESC;
```

## üîç 5. Trend & Correlation Analysis
